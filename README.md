## Problem Description
Joe Royer requested that I develop and redesign a website.  This website shows data from a weather station located at the Penn State York campus.  The previous design was outdated and needed to be refreshed to fit Penn State's branding and color scheme.  It should also display the data clearly and have the most important data on the main page.  The last detail was for it to be mobile-friendly.  
## Brainstorming
My initial steps were to use a front-end framework to give me the styling and mobile responsiveness I needed.  I decided to use Bootstrap 4 as I was very familiar with the grid-based layout used to structure pages.  For styling guidance I referenced another Penn State York website for [Student Activity Fees](http://saf.york.psu.edu/).  I also viewed many weather websites for ideas on how to present the data effectively. I was then able to analyze how I would recieve the data, which would require JavaScript (jQuery) since the incoming data was in a JSON format.
## Steps

### Design
The original design of the website:

First draft of the redesign:

Using comical placeholder data, I focused on the layout and visual styling for the redesign.  I chose temperature to be the largest and most important piece of data on the home page, with a "Feels Like" temperature right below it.  The data to the right of the temperature section would have more detailed data for the current day in a table format.  This table is very similar to the previous design's, but adapted for the new visuals.  

Second draft:

I began to change details about the design, like font size, proper grid alignment, and bolded headers for the table sections.

Final design:

The final design features a stylish and fuctional navigation bar, with two clear data sections on the main page.  These design concepts were used on the other pages that present weather data in a gauge format (a JavaScript library reused from the previous website, [drawn with SteelSeries and scripted by Mark Crossley](https://cumuluswiki.org/a/SteelSeries_Gauges)):

As well pages showing monthly, yearly, and other various records:
