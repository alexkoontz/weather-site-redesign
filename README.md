## Problem Description
Joe Royer requested that I develop and redesign a website.  This website shows data from a weather station located at the Penn State York campus.  The previous design was outdated and needed to be refreshed to fit Penn State's branding and color scheme.  It should also display the data clearly and have the most important data on the main page.  The last detail was for it to be mobile-friendly.  
## Brainstorming
My initial steps were to use a front-end framework to give me the styling and mobile responsiveness I needed.  I decided to user Bootstrap 4 as I was very familiar with the grid-based layout used to structure pages.  For styling guidance I referenced another Penn State York website for [Student Activity Fees](http://saf.york.psu.edu/). I was then able to analyze how I would recieve the data, which would require JavaScript (jQuery) since the incoming data was in a JSON format.
## Steps
