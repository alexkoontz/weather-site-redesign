## Problem Description
Joe Royer requested that I develop and redesign a website.  This website shows data from a weather station located at the Penn State York campus.  The previous design was outdated and needed to be refreshed to fit Penn State's branding and color scheme.  It should also display the data clearly and have the most important data on the main page
